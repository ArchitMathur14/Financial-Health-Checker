2️⃣ Indian Stocks — With a Suffix
For Indian stocks (NSE/BSE), you must append exchange suffixes:

.NS → NSE

.BO → BSE

Examples that work:

Ticker input	Meaning
RELIANCE.NS	Reliance Industries (NSE)
TATASTEEL.NS	Tata Steel (NSE)
SBIN.NS	State Bank of India (NSE)

This format is required; without the suffix, yfinance won’t find the data.
